I will begin by building a web application using React as the interface for the tasks.
 I will use DataDog's APIs to fetch data such as Monitor and Metrics and display this data in tables within my React app.
  In my app, I will create a button labeled "Create New Monitor." When clicked, it should open a form where users can enter details for a new monitor. Upon form submission, I will send the data to DataDog to create the monitor and then add the new monitor to my app's table.
   I will configure a webhook in DataDog to receive monitor event updates. I will display these updates in my React app.
      After everything is completed, I will deploy the app to a server.
